SailBabel
=========

SailBabel is an offline dictionary for Sailfish OS.  Note that SailBabel
does not include translations or wordlists.  Just copy your own
set of translations to /home/nemo/sailbabel/dictionary.txt.  This
file is expected to contain two tab-separated columns each containing
a word or phrase in one language and its translation into another
language.  Dictionary text files may be downloaded from e.g.
