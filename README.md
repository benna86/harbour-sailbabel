SailBabel
=========

SailBabel is an offline dictionary for Sailfish OS.  Note that this 
program does not include translations or wordlists.  Just copy your 
own set of translations to a text file in the sub-folder Dictionaries 
within the Documents directory.  This file is expected to contain two 
tab-separated columns each containing a word or phrase in one language 
and its translation into another language, respectively.  Dictionary 
text files may be downloaded from e.g.
http://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e
